  |   Shakedown: Hawaii follows three protagonists through a 16-bit open    |
  |   world. Build your own "legitimate" corporation by completing          |
  |   missions, acquiring businesses, sabotaging competitors, "re-zoning"   |
  |   land, and shaking down shops for protection money.                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Explore the island by foot, by car, or by boat. It's filled with      |
  |   arcade challenges, sidequests, stores to shop at, houses to burgle,   |
  |   civilians to interact with, and secrets to discover.                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   You begin your adventure as an aging CEO, struggling to make sense    |
  |   of the modern world. Online shopping killed his retail stores, ride   |
  |   sharing his taxi business, and streaming his video stores. To save    |
  |   the company, he'll need to learn the "methods" of modern business,    |
  |   and use them to rebuild his empire.                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The entire island is up for grabs... or at least, could be with the   |
  |   right business model.                                                 |
